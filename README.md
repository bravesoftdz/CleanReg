CleanReg
========

This program searches through the Windows registry for the keywords given and displays all entries found in a list. You can then, with the click of a button, remove these entries from the registry.  This helps to clean things out after a program has been "uninstalled" but leaves left-over settings you no longer need to keep.

DISCLAIMER: Modifying the system registry can render your system unusable or may cause other unknown problems.Use caution and ALWAYS make a backup.
